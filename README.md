# Using Synthetic Camera Poses for Camera Calibration in Soccer Videos
<p>
 A novel two-stage approach for estimating the parameters that define a camera perspective within a soccer stadium. The approach uses deep learning models that have been trained using synthetic data exclusively. The method's output is used to localize players, referees, and the ball within the field during a match. The method is described in the related <a href=https://rdcu.be/dNDka>paper</a>
